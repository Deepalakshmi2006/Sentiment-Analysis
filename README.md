# Sentiment-Analysis
A Streamlit-based sentiment analysis app that uses a tweet dataset to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. Tweets are cleaned, vectorized using TF-IDF, and analyzed with a trained ML model. The app provides fast, real-time predictions through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

# Sentiment Analysis Web App

## Overview
This project is a **web-based Sentiment Analysis application** that classifies tweets as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. It uses **machine learning** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze the emotional tone of text. The app is built using **Streamlit**, providing a simple and interactive interface for users.

The system processes input tweets by cleaning and preprocessing the text (removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and stopwords), tokenizing, and converting it to numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**. A **trained ML model** (Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes) predicts the sentiment of the input text in real-time.
